Add contentPermalink
Create a corresponding folder (e.g. <source>/_staff_members) and add documents. Front matter is processed if the front matter exists, and everything after the front matter is pushed into the document’s content attribute. If no front matter is provided, Jekyll will consider it to be a static file and the contents will not undergo further processing. If front matter is provided, Jekyll will process the file contents into the expected output.

Regardless of whether front matter exists or not, Jekyll will write to the destination directory (e.g. _site) only if output: true has been set in the collection’s metadata.

For example here’s how you would add a staff member to the collection set above. The filename is ./_staff_members/jane.md with the following content:

```
name: Jane Doe
position: Developer

Jane has worked on Jekyll for the past *five years*.
Do note that in spite of being considered as a collection internally, the above doesn’t apply to posts. Posts with a valid filename format will be marked for processing even if they do not contain front matter.
